# Donate

If you find my open-source work useful, please consider supporting me.

All of my projects are a labor of love, an unpaid volunteer work done in my spare time.

I don't receive donations often and appreciate every donation I receive, no matter how small.

Just to give a perspective, during the 3 year period from 2021 to 2024, I received a total of 3 donations, totaling $18 USD.
This might come as a surprise, as some of my projects have over 200,000 downloads, but the reality is that barely anyone donates.
However, when someone does donate, it always brightens my day :)

## Ways to donate

- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=9HJHAH5UDL3GL)

- PayPal
  - Pros:
    - No PayPal account required; allows to donate with just a debit or a credit card
    - Allows to donate using a PayPal account, if you do have one
    - Allows to select which of my projects the donation is for
    - Allows to leave a short text note along with the donation
    - Shows the fee PayPal would take out of your donation and allows you to cover it
    - I receive the donation immediately
  - Cons:
    - Takes a fee (it shows what the fee is when setting the donation amount)

- GitHub Sponsors
  - Pros:
    - Takes no fee if the donation is done from a personal GitHub account
  - Cons:
    - Requires a GitHub account in order to donate
    - Takes a big 6% fee if the donation is done from an organization GitHub account
    - I receive the donation only after my GitHub Sponsors balance reaches $100 USD

I prefer PayPal and Bitcoin over GitHub Sponsors, as I receive the donations from them immediately.
However, feel free to donate using any method that is convenient to you, any donation is better than no donation.

If you have read thus far -- thank you for considering supporting me!
