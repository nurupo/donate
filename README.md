# Donate

All my open source work is unpaid volunteer work done in my free time, so please consider donating if you find my work useful.

I don't receive donations often and appreciate any donation I receive, no matter how small.

For example, during a 3 year period from January 1st 2021 to January 1st 2024, I received just 3 donations, totaling $18 USD.

- PayPal
  - Pros:
    - No PayPal account required, allows to donate with just a debit or a credit card
    - Allows to donate using a PayPal account, if you do have one
    - Allows to select which of my projects the donation is for
    - Allows to leave a short text note along with the donation
    - Shows the fee PayPal would take out of your donation and allows you to cover it
    - I receive the donation immediately
  - Cons:
    - Takes a fee (it shows what the fee is when setting the donation amount)

- GitHub Sponsors
  - Pros:
    - Takes no fee if the donation is done from a personal GitHub account
  - Cons:
    - Requires a GitHub account in order to donate
    - Takes a big 6% fee if the donation is done from an organization GitHub account
    - I receive the donation only after my GitHub Sponsors balance reaches $100 USD

I prefer PayPal and Bitcoin, as I receive the donations from them immediately.
However, feel free to donate using any method that is convenient to you, any donation is better than no donation.

If you have read thus far -- thank you for considering making a donation!
