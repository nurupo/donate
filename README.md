# Donate

If you find my open-source work useful, please consider supporting me.

All of my projects are a labor of love, an unpaid volunteer work done in my spare time.

I don't receive donations often and appreciate every donation I receive, no matter how small.

Just to give a perspective, during the 3 year period from 2021 to 2024, I received a total of 3 donations, totaling $18 USD.
This might come as a surprise, as some of my projects have over 200,000 downloads, but the reality is that barely anyone donates.
However, when someone does donate, it always brightens my day :)

I prefer GitHub Sponsors as there is no fee -- I receive the donation in full.
However, feel free to donate using any method that is convenient to you, any donation is better than no donation.

If you have read thus far -- thank you for considering supporting me!
